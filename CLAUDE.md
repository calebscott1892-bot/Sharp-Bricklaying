# Sharp Bricklaying

Client site for Sharp Bricklaying, Perth. Brain `client_id`: `sharp`. Retainer on a prepaid annual care plan.
Live at https://sharpbricklaying.com.au. Static HTML, no framework, GSAP from npm. The contact form posts to `api/send-email.js`, a Vercel function that sends through Resend to luke@sharpbricklaying.com.au.

## The brain
The C4 business database is Cloudflare D1, id `8bb6ab46-8e88-47f8-adff-16316dd2f03e` (MCP tool `d1_database_query`).
Read it before asserting any business fact: `SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = 'sharp'`, and `site_issues` for open faults.
Before finishing a session that changed anything here, append a row to `work_log` (repo, client_id, what, why, files, shipped, verified_how).
The database wins over this file and every other markdown file.

## How it deploys
Vercel, project `sharp-bricklaying`, git-linked to `c4studios/Sharp-Bricklaying`. A push to `main` deploys. There is no `.vercel` folder here and none is needed.

## Page structure
The site is multi-page as of 6 Sep 2026. Routes come from directories, not from Vercel rewrites, so `/gallery` is `gallery/index.html`. Keep that pattern for anything new.

- `index.html` — hero, services, about, a three-project **featured work** teaser, a contact band. It no longer holds the portfolio or the enquiry form.
- `gallery/index.html` — the full portfolio: the two standalone groups plus the tabbed job panels. This is where gallery work goes now, not `index.html`.
- `contact/index.html` — the enquiry form, contact details, and the "what to send" guidance.
- `articles/` — the Site Notes section. Deliberately uses its own chrome (`css/articles.css`, `.site-topbar`) rather than the main nav, because it is a reading surface. If you unify it, `styles.css` sets `section { opacity: 0 }` and relies on `main.js` to reveal, so article sections would vanish without that script.

**Pages below the root reference assets root-relative** (`/images/…`, `/css/…`, `/js/…`). A relative `images/…` on `/gallery` resolves to `/gallery/images/…` and 404s. `index.html` is at the root so it keeps relative paths.

The nav and footer are duplicated across four files with no build step. Change one, change all four, and keep the markup identical.

## Traps in this repo
`_headers` and `_redirects` are Netlify syntax. Vercel ignores both completely. Headers go in `vercel.json`, which already carries `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `frame-ancestors 'none'` (shipped 4 Sep 2026, verified live with curl). Add any new header there, not to `_headers`.

`Sharp Bricklaying.html` at the root is an old export, tracked in git, still mentioning .net. It is not served and is not the source of anything. Leave it unless the job is to delete it.

Two ABNs appear on the invoice; only one is the paying entity. Check the brain before quoting either.

The About section photo has `luke@sharpbricklaying.net` burned into the image. It cannot be fixed in code and needs a replacement photo from Luke.

## Checks before you push
`npm test` runs `scripts/validate-content.js`. It is strict on purpose: every image and video in a registered folder must appear in the matching panel with exact counts, the canonical of each page must be the `.com.au` URL, every page must link to `/gallery`, `/contact` and `/articles/`, and no served file may contain the string `sharpbricklaying.net`. Update the validator whenever gallery markup or media changes.

Serve with `npm run dev` (`npx serve -l 3000`). Root-relative paths break under `file://`, so never verify by opening the file directly.

**`npx serve` is more forgiving than Vercel.** It resolves `/foo` to `foo.html`; Vercel does not, and `cleanUrls` is off. An extensionless link can pass locally and 404 in production, which is exactly how the first article shipped broken on 6 Sep 2026. Every route is a directory with an `index.html`, and the validator now checks that every internal link and every sitemap URL resolves to a real file. After any push, curl the live URL rather than trusting the local server.

## Standing rules that bite here
Never fabricate a testimonial, review or figure. Use a visible `[PLACEHOLDER]` marker instead.
Verify in a real browser or with curl before reporting anything as done. Reading the source is not verification.
Never `git add -A`. Stage the files you changed by name.
